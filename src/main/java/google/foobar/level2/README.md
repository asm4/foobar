En Route Salute
===============

Commander Lambda loves efficiency and hates anything that wastes time. She's a busy lamb, after all! She generously rewards henchmen who identify sources of inefficiency and come up with ways to remove them. You've spotted one such source, and you think solving it will help you build the reputation you need to get promoted.

Every time the Commander's employees pass each other in the hall, each of them must stop and salute each other - one at a time - before resuming their path. A salute is five seconds long, so each exchange of salutes takes a full ten seconds (Commander Lambda's salute is a bit, er, involved). You think that by removing the salute requirement, you could save several collective hours of employee time per day. But first, you need to show her how bad the problem really is.

Write a program that counts how many salutes are exchanged during a typical walk along a hallway. The hall is represented by a string. For example:
"--->-><-><-->-"

Each hallway string will contain three different types of characters: '>', an employee walking to the right; '<', an employee walking to the left; and '-', an empty space. Every employee walks at the same speed either to right or to the left, according to their direction. Whenever two employees cross, each of them salutes the other. They then continue walking until they reach the end, finally leaving the hallway. In the above example, they salute 10 times.

Write a function answer(s) which takes a string representing employees walking along a hallway and returns the number of times the employees will salute. s will contain at least 1 and at most 100 characters, each one of -, >, or <.

Power Hungry
============

Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen has been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you can't take them all down at once without shutting down the space station (and all those pesky life support systems!).

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function answer(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30.  So answer([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the answer as a string representation of the number.
